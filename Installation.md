# Introduction #

As EsculapaUML is based on Eclipse platform we provide automatic installation and update site for it.

`https://esculapa-uml.eclipselabs.org.codespot.com/git/update_site/`

# Step by Step #

We currently provide integration with **Topcased** (version 5.1.0 or older) so if you plan to use EsculapaUML for modelling you should install it in Topcased: http://www.topcased.org/

Remember to choose the correct version of Topcased (version 5.1.0) or if you choose version 5.2.0 or newer, you must install additionally "old UML editors" plugins because they are not included in new versions; new Papyrus editors are not yet supported in EsculapaUML. At the moment of developing EsculpaUML, new Papyrus editors were still too unstable to use.

Detailed instructions:
  * In Topcased main menu click _Help > Install New Software_.
